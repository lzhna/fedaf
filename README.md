# Adaptive Model Fusion in Federated Learning via Knowledge Filtering

This repository provides the implementation of the paper: Adaptive Model Fusion in Federated Learning via Knowledge Filtering.

To run FedAF with default setting (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-8):

``python main.py``

To run experiments with other federate learning approaches (FedAvg or FedDF) or other settings, the modification the runtime parameters according to ``compo\utils\parameters.py`` is needed.
